### Heyo fellow people ðŸ‘‹

**A little about me:**

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Accounting, Digital Media, and what this website is all about. I have _no_ technical experience whatsoever except for building my own PC (Even then, I barely knew what I was doing!) and playing ðŸŒŸ Video Games ðŸŒŸ
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my two cats and you will never hear silence again. ðŸ¤«
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email!
