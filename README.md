### Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my two degrees! I expect to graduate in Fall of 2023, so here's to hoping! 🤞
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Accounting, Digital Media, and what this website is all about. I have _no_ technical experience whatsoever except for building my own PC (Even then, I barely knew what I was doing!) and playing 🌟 Video Games 🌟
- 💬 Ask me about my two cats and you will never hear silence again. 🤫
- 📫 How to reach me: Email!
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite color is green and my least favorite color is yellow. Tell me how that happened.

Yep!

Hobbies include: (WHEN I'M NOT STUDYING AND DOING HOMEWORK) Reading! Writing! Video Games! Being lazy! Eating! Cooking! Anything and everything a normal human does when they have free time!
